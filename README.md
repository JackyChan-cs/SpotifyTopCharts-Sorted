# SpotifyTopCharts-Sorted
Sorted names of spotify top charts 
Read in spotify top charts csv to which I alphabetically sorted the list by artist names. I first ran the csv through a buffreader to read all the contents of the csv file, to which I then separated them by spliting the commas. I located the coloum with artist names and inserted that into an individual array. I sorted this array alphabetically. Then I created a Linked List class and a Node class which included its own insert and display methods, and I just inserted and displayed the list of artists.
